Build Intructions:

 Copy and paste code into the online calculator
 demo on Jison website. Type you LOLCODE phrase
 and click "parse". This parser only handles
 single line inputs.
 
 KTHX & KTHXBYE:
 
 I tried to get KTHX to return a new line
 but had no luck. I got very close but the 
 parser kept returning "K" which caused
 the parser to fail when it read "K". 
 
 I also tried to make the parser recognize 
 KTHXBYE as the end of file key word. Also
 had no luck with this :(
